Upgrade allows a VNXe to go from an existing version of software to a new version of software.  You must create a special upgrade image to perform the upgrade with.  Please see section V for more details.

A.	Performing a Upgrade

1.  Transfer image to machine 

a.  Copy image to / on PRIMARY SP
b.  Verify the image is a VNXe image
gpg /VNXe*upgrade*tgz.bin.gpg  
c.  Make upgrade directory and move/unpack image
mkdir -p /var/tmp/upgrade/images
cd /var/tmp/upgrade/images
mv /VNXe*upgrade*tgz.bin /var/tmp/upgrade/images
chmod +x VNXe*.tgz.bin
./VNXe*upgrade*tgz.bin –-unpack

Copy image to / on other SP:
a.	 Create upgrade directory on the Other SP.
 	mkdir -p  /var/tmp/upgrade/images
b.	 Copy image to /var/tmp/upgrade/images
mv /VNXe*upgrade*tgz.bin /var/tmp/upgrade/images
chmod +x VNXe*.tgz.bin
./VNXe*upgrade*tgz.bin –unpack

2.  Start Upgrade

	Manual:
		Go to primary SP:
cd /var/tmp/upgrade/images/*tmpdir
./upgrade_mgr/upgrade_mgr.pl  (must run from outside upgrade_mgr dir)


Note: If you run the upgrade script from another SP, it will give below message:
 
root@egreen-1128-spb spb:/var/tmp/upgrade/images/VNXe-MR4SP4-upgrade-2.4.4.22638-2.4.4.22638-1551949196-MAGNUM-DEBUG.tgz.bin.tmpdir> ./upgrade_mgr/upgrade_mgr.pl
Fatal Error: Upgrades must be initiated on the primary SP.
Action: Initiate the upgrade on the other SP and try again.
